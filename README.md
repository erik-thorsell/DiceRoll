## Installation

```

Run `index.html` to start the game.

## Instructions
The game starts off by picking a random player.

You then get to roll the dice using the `Roll` button.

What the dice shows is added to your `current score`, and you get to roll again.

If you roll a `1` at any point, you lose your `current score` and the turn is passed to the other player.

The `hold` button adds the `current score` to the `total score` and passes the turn to the other player.


The player who first reaches a `total score` of `100` wins the game!
